# TODO The template is currently a bit weird -- there's a mix of DAG VARS
# ($(varname)) and things filled in at write time ({resource.name})
# The externalities won't work as currently written, but are here as a placeholder.
# Is this a place where t-strings can help?? It's such new hotness that I don't
# know that it's a good requirement.
# Conceptually the current separation makes sense, since some are dependent on
# externalities like the target resource, but it needs cleaner definitions.
