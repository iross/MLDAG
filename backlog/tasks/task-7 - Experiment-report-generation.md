## Description
Create some scripts that help generate "final" statistics for experiment runs. Things of interest:

- Breakdown of how many epochs were created in each resource (Expanse, Delta, Anvil, AWS, Bridges-2, OSPool)
- Breakdown of how much time was spent on each resource (Expanse, Delta, Anvil, AWS, Bridges-2, OSPool)
  - Including time spent on successful vs unsuccessful runs (Out of x hours spent computing, how many succeeded and resulted in a successful epoch)
- Resource requests and usage:
  - What GPUs were used and in what mixture?
  - How much memory was requested? Used?
  - How much CPU was requested? Used?
  - How much disk was requested? Used?
  - How much network bandwidth was requested? Used?

Inputs should be csvs that are created via the new `post_experiment_csv.py` script.

Use pandas and seaborn (and matplotlib, if necessary) as the primary tools for data analysis and visualization.

The input csv should be a command line argument with a default of job_summary.csv.

The style of the figures should be consistent across all the different plots.

   - Design data structures for efficient analysis

2. **Core Analysis Script Development**
   - Create main `experiment_report.py` script with CLI interface
   - Implement data loading and validation functions
   - Create helper functions for epoch extraction from job names
   - Implement resource efficiency calculations

3. **Resource Utilization Analysis**
   - Implement epoch counting per resource with success/failure breakdown
   - Calculate total computation time per resource

   - Add error handling for malformed data

## Implementation Notes

### Research Findings:
- **Available Data**: Current CSV contains resource types (expanse, delta, anvil, bridges2, ospool), job statuses, GPU info, timing data, and transfer data
- **Epoch Extraction**: Job names contain epoch information (epoch0-epoch29) that can be parsed for analysis
- **Transfer Data**: Total bytes sent/received already available in CSV output
- **Resources**: 5 distinct resources with good coverage across all major HPC centers

### Implementation Decisions:
- **Input**: Default to `job_summary.csv` (updated from `job_output.csv`)
- **Network Analysis**: Focus on job data transfer (bytes sent/received) rather than HTCondor internal metrics  
- **Visualization**: Individual PNG files for each chart type with consistent styling
- **Resource Usage**: Defer CPU/memory/disk usage enhancement to future iteration
- **Scope**: Build comprehensive analysis with current data, enhance data collection later

### Key Analysis Areas:
1. **Resource Efficiency**: Epoch completion rates and computation time per resource
2. **GPU Utilization**: Distribution and efficiency across different GPU types
3. **Transfer Analysis**: Network usage patterns and efficiency metrics
4. **Success Metrics**: Resource-specific performance insights and recommendations

- **Data Processing**: Automatic epoch and run extraction from job names using regex patterns
- **Resource Analysis**: Complete breakdown of computation time, success rates, and efficiency per resource
- **GPU Analysis**: Comprehensive utilization metrics including type distribution and success rates
- **Transfer Analysis**: Network usage patterns and efficiency metrics across resources
- **Visualization**: 7 different PNG plots with consistent seaborn/matplotlib styling
- **Summary Report**: Detailed text report with key statistics and insights

### Key Findings from Initial Analysis:
- **Overall Success Rate**: 73.9% across 901 job attempts
- **Best Performing Resource**: OSPool (76.8% success rate, 4,373 hours computation)
- **Most Reliable GPUs**: NVIDIA A40 and RTX A5000 (85%+ success rates)
- **Data Transfer**: 18,367 GB total, primarily through OSPool
- **Time Efficiency**: 54% overall (successful computation time vs total time)

### Technical Implementation:
- **Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy
- **CLI Interface**: Argparse with default job_summary.csv input
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and graceful failure handling
- **Modularity**: Clean class-based architecture with separated analysis functions
