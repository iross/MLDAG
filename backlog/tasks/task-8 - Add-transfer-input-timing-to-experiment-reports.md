## Description

Enhance experiment_report.py and post_experiment_csv.py to extract and display how long each job spent in the transferring input state from metl.log

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 experiment_report.py extracts transfer input timing from metl.log,post_experiment_csv.py includes transfer input duration in CSV output,Transfer timing data is accurately parsed and displayed,Documentation updated to reflect new metrics
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze metl.log format to understand transfer input state logging
2. Review current experiment_report.py implementation to understand data extraction patterns
3. Review current post_experiment_csv.py implementation to understand CSV generation
4. Add parser logic to extract transfer input state timestamps from metl.log
5. Calculate duration for each job's transfer input phase
6. Integrate transfer timing into experiment_report.py output
7. Add transfer input duration column to post_experiment_csv.py CSV output
8. Test with sample metl.log files to verify accuracy
9. Update documentation/comments to explain new metrics

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented transfer input timing tracking in both experiment_report.py and post_experiment_csv.py.

## Approach Taken
- Analyzed metl.log format and identified event 040 as the file transfer event containing 'Started transferring input files' and 'Finished transferring input files' messages
- Transfer events occur BEFORE job execution (event 001), so implemented backwards search from execution start time to find the most recent transfer completion
- Added transfer_input_start_time and transfer_input_end_time fields to the JobAttempt dataclass

## Features Implemented
1. **post_experiment_csv.py**:
   - Extended event parsing to include event 040 (file transfer)
   - Added _parse_transfer_timing() method to extract transfer start/end timestamps
   - Added logic to match transfer events to correct execution attempts by searching backwards in time
   - Added 4 new CSV columns: Transfer Input Start Time, Transfer Input End Time, Transfer Input Duration (seconds), Transfer Input Duration (human)

2. **experiment_report.py**:
   - Added analyze_transfer_input_timing() method to compute statistics by resource
   - Added plot_transfer_input_timing() method to generate box plots and bar charts
   - Integrated transfer timing analysis into generate_all_reports()
   - Added transfer timing section to summary report with mean, median, and total hours

## Technical Decisions
- Transfer events are matched to execution attempts by looking backwards from execution start time since file transfer happens before job execution begins
- Parser processes transfer events in reverse chronological order to find the most recent 'Finished transferring input files' before each execution
- Duration calculation reuses existing calculate_duration() method for consistency

## Modified Files
- post_experiment_csv.py: Added transfer timing parsing and CSV export
- experiment_report.py: Added transfer timing analysis and visualization

## Testing
- Tested with production metl.log (151,896 lines, 554 execution events)
- Successfully captured transfer timing for 39 jobs with valid start/end pairs
- Generated visualizations showing transfer duration distribution by resource
